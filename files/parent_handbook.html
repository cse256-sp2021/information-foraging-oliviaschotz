      <h2>Clothing</h2> 
      <p>It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are comfortable, washable, and 
        suitable for activities both indoors and outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of 
        clothing appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should be aware of weather 
        conditions and dress children accordingly, as outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. 
        During the winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will usually go outside when 
        it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent 
        marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified. 
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Snacks</h2>
      <p>The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, 
        pears, bananas, melons, etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s refrigerator.” 
        There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham, Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists 
        of a fruit, crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own water.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Allergies </h2>
      <p>If your child has a known allergic reaction, this must be documented on the child’s History and Health 
        Record kept in his/ her file in the office. Also, please report these allergies to the classroom teachers. 
        For your child’s safety, these allergies will be posted in your child’s classroom. If you object to this 
        information being posted, please contact the director. In case of severe allergies such as to bee stings 
        or nuts, an EpiPen Injector Kit may be kept at the nursery school and used by the director and/or teachers 
        who are trained in its administration. This is stored in the emergency backpack in the child’s classroom. Each 
        classroom has a First Aid Kit that includes the EpiPen (if required). This, along with emergency medical forms for 
        every child, accompanies the classes on all walking or driving field trips.
