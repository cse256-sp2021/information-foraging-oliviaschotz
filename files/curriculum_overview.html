          Parent-Staff Communication
        </h2>
        <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information 
        on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your 
        child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, 
        please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.

          Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences
        </h2>
        <p>
        Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, 
        conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep 
        notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development.
        Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children's writings and pictures.
        Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills
        for children.The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, 
        getting-to-know0the-child-and-family discussion. The spring confrence includes a more detailed,
        written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during hte year as needed and 
        by request of parents and/or teachers.

          Discipline
        </h2>
        <p>
          The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe. <br><br>
  
          The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer. 
          <br><br>
          Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through: 
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li> 
            <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
            <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings</li>
            <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
            <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
          </ul>

        Visual Arts
      </h2> 
      <p>At Washington University Nursery School, we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and experiences include: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials and items </li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects </li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling </li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling </li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other recyclable materials </li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
