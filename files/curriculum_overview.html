        Visual Arts
      </h2> 
      <p>At Washington University Nursery School, we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and experiences include: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials and items </li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects </li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling </li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling </li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other recyclable materials </li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
